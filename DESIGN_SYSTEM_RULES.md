# Design System Rules

This document outlines the design system structure and conventions for the `my-app` project, intended to help integrate Figma designs consistently.

## 1. Token Definitions

Design tokens are defined as CSS Custom Properties (variables) on the `:root` element. This allows for global access and easy theming.

-   **Location**: Tokens are primarily defined in `src/styles/tokens.css` and included in the global `src/styles.css`.
-   **Format**: Standard CSS variable syntax.

**Example (`src/styles/tokens.css`):**
```css
:root {
  --surface-primary-rest: #040804;
  --surface-base-rest: #ffffff;
  --stroke-muted-rest: #dbe0eb;
  --spacing-lg: 28px;
  --spacing-md: 20px;
  --border-thin: 1px;
}
```

## 2. Component Library

The project uses a standard Angular component architecture. Each component is self-contained within its own directory.

-   **Location**: Components are located in `src/app/`.
-   **Architecture**: Each component consists of three separate files:
    -   `component-name.component.ts` (TypeScript logic)
    -   `component-name.component.html` (HTML template)
    -   `component-name.component.css` (Component-specific styles)
-   **Example (`ButtonComponent`):**
    -   `src/app/button/button.component.ts`
    -   `src/app/button/button.component.html`
    -   `src/app/button/button.component.css`

## 3. Frameworks & Libraries

-   **UI Framework**: **Angular** is the core framework for the application.
-   **Styling**: **Vanilla CSS** is used for styling, enhanced with CSS Custom Properties for tokens. There are no other third-party styling libraries like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap.
-   **Build System**: **Angular CLI** is used for all development, build, and testing tasks (`ng serve`, `ng build`).

## 4. Asset Management

Assets like images and icons are stored locally within the project.

-   **Storage Location**: All static assets should be placed in the `src/assets/` directory. The `angular.json` file is configured to serve this directory.
-   **Referencing**: Assets are referenced in component templates using a relative path from the `assets` root.

**Example (`button.component.html`):**
```html
<img alt="chevron down icon" src="assets/chevron-down-icon.svg" />
```

## 5. Icon System

The project uses individual SVG files for icons.

-   **Storage**: Icons are stored as `.svg` files in the `src/assets/` directory.
-   **Usage**: Icons are embedded directly into components using `<img>` tags.
-   **Naming Convention**: Icon filenames should be descriptive and use kebab-case (e.g., `chevron-down-icon.svg`).

## 6. Styling Approach

The project uses a hybrid styling approach with both global and component-scoped styles.

-   **Methodology**:
    -   **Global Styles**: Found in `src/styles.css`. This file defines global settings like `body` margin and includes the design tokens.
    -   **Component Styles**: Each component has its own `.css` file, which is automatically scoped by Angular to prevent styles from leaking.
-   **Responsive Design**: No specific responsive design patterns have been established yet. Future implementations should use standard CSS media queries within the relevant component's stylesheet.

## 7. Project Structure

The codebase follows the standard file organization generated by the Angular CLI.

-   **Root**: `src/`
-   **Application Code**: `src/app/`
-   **Components**: Each component resides in its own subdirectory within `src/app/` (e.g., `src/app/button/`).
-   **Global Assets**: `src/assets/`
-   **Global Styles**: `src/styles.css`
-   **Figma Connections**: Code Connect files are co-located with their corresponding components (e.g., `src/app/button/button.figma.ts`).
